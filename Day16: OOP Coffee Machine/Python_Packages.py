# Interesting fact - Initially this file was titled 'turtle.py' and this doesn't
# work then because there is a circular import.
# Don't name a file the same as a python package

# from turtle import Turtle
# timmy = Turtle()
# timmy.color("orange")
# timmy.pensize(5)
# timmy.shape("turtle")
# timmy.forward(100)

# from prettytable import PrettyTable
# # table is an object in the class PrettyTable() which is in Pascal casing
# # Pascal casing - each word begins with a capital letter for a class
# table = PrettyTable()
# table.add_column("Pokemon Name", ["Pikachu", "Squirtle", "Charmander"])
# table.add_column("Type", ["Electric", "Water", "Fire"])
# table.align = 'l'
# print(table)
